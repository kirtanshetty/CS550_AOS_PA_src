SUPERPEER
number of superpeers = length of this array = 8
i = id for superpeer
element at index i = list of superpeers to which superpeer i should connect

PEER
number of peers = length of this array = 17
j = config id for peer (actual useful id assigned by superpeer will be different; this is just for static configuration)
element at index j = id of superpeer to which peer with config id j should connect
each of the eight superpeers will have 1-3 peers connected to it

BUFFERSIZE
size of the historical message buffer
so a superpeer knows if it has seen/forwarded a query message before
and knows where to back-propagate a queryhit message

TTL
time to live
so a message is not forwarded indefinitely
