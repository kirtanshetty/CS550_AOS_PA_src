PA3 TO DO, NOTES, AND KNOWN BUGS
/* --- start PA3 change --- */
/* ---- end PA3 change ---- */

- is there a way to mark a file READONLY after we download it?
    managing folders seems messy, but we might have to do that
- shutting down a client that has invalid/deregistered files throws an exception
- I don't understand when the watch directory service returns EVENT_MODIFY vs EVENT_CREATE
- shutting down a peer with an invalidated file throws an exception
- what happens when two peers start with the same file (or file with the same name)?
    who owns it?
    is this allowed?
    one will invalidate the other?
- sometimes retrieving a file will trigger events of type CREATE, MODIFY, or BOTH.
    I'm not sure when each happens but it's a problem
- right now to find out if TTR expired, we keep track of the lastVerified timestamp and when thread wake up, if more than TTR has passed since then, we poll
    poll just returns true or false depending on the validity of the version of the file. true = just update lastVerfied. false = invalidate & deregister
    however, the assignment seems to imply that the best way is to decrement TTR until it is zero and then invalidate the file
      when thread wakes up, decrement all TTR as appropriate. Those that are 0, poll
      poll returns invalid message or a new TTR to replace the one that is now zero
      either way, we check first that we are not the owner of the file. we don't need to poll for our own files, obviously.
- assignment suggests to poll the SERVER but ours is written to poll the PEER CLIENT.
    we did it this way because the client keeps track of the validity of all its files. invalid files get deregistered
- factor out all "invalidate and deregister" blocks of code into a single function
- print statements for polling functions get annoying so they have been commented out
- when a file is downloaded, the auto-update mechanism generates  MODIFY event for the file, so the client will print
    "YOU HAVE ILLEGALLY MODIFIED A FILE YOU DO NOT OWN." even though it shouldn't for a new file,
    therefore we CAN'T actually invalidate and deregister, even though we would like to for the general/actual case
    of modifying a file that you do not own. That is why the code that says " IT IS NOW INVALID AND DEREGISTERED" is commented out

COMPLETED
PULL-BASED APPROACH
  the version in RetrievedFileInfo acts as the last-modified-time
  when a client polls about a file it owns and the version is the same (file is valid),
    it just updates the lastVerified Date to now
  add extra fields to the FileInfo class as specified
    origin server ID, TTR, last-modified-time
    last-modified-time is the latest version of the master
    the TTR is specified by the SERVER (this is why it is in the FileInfo class)
  figure out how to tell when TTR has expired
    store the TTR and a timestamp of when the file was saved in the new data structure (specified above)
    if the new thread (specified below) detects that current time >= file timestamp + TTR, then the TTR has expired
  add a POLL class? NO
    file name, version
  add poll remote function to superpeer
    receives filename and version from a peer with a downloaded copy of a file
    check version agaginst the registry that contains the master file
    if master is newer respond with out-of-date indication message
  create new thread on CLIENT that sleeps for TTR time (or maybe fraction of it) and then wakes up and checks the TTR for each downloaded file
    if TTR expired (using method described above), then call poll on the ORIGINAL server (this info is stored in the client's new file data structure)
    if poll returns file out-of-date message, deregister and delete it
    print that it is doing so
    eager polling seems easier than lazy polling
    otherwise return new TTR
  parse validationMethod and timeToRefresh from the config file
  add  option to client terminal prompt to "refresh" an outdated file
    download a new copy of that file, update data structure accordingly

PUSH-BASED APPROACH
  implement INVALIDATION message class
    as spcified in assignment
    with TTL?
  implement data structure for CLIENT to keep track of all files and their validation creds
    this structure is only used in the auto-update mechanism thread (?)
    this will be used to check whether
  new remote function for superpeer to send and receive INVALIDATION message
    similar to forwardQuery()
    in this remote function, the server will broadcast INVALIDATION message to neighor superpeers (use same TTL from config file)
    INVALIDATION message is broadcasted just like QUERY message
    called by the auto-update mechanism thread of the client
    check the existing data structure to see if this superpeer has an entry for the file
    for every connected leafnode peer client that is NOT the owner of this file,
      deregister it and notify leafnode peer client to delete it
  at startup, client should load all its files into the fileStore of RetrievedFileInfo's, and mark the OWNER field as TRUE
  new data structure for superpeer to track whethere an INVALIDATION message has been seen before
    do we need this? is it a problem if a superpeer receives the same INVALIDATION message twice?
  new remote function for leafnode peer client to discard invalidated file
    called by the above remote function of the superpeer
    deletes file (UPDATE: NO.)
  if the auto-update mechanism detects file MODIFIED AND NOT THE OWNER, just deregister and delete it?
    this is an issue and theoretically this case shouldn't exist
    practically, a modification of a local copy of a foreign file should be treated just
      like if the modification were to have happened on the master copy; only this time,
      the modification is not valid and so this peer does not get the privelege of broadcasting
      an INVALIDATION message to anyone. it basically just invalidated the file itself.
  when the auto-update mechanism detects file MODIFIED AND IT IS THE OWNER, call the server with new version details
    this call will happen from the auto update mechanism thread
    may need to send TTL to server? included in INVALIDATION message
    TTL: then we have to handle whether the superpeer has the the INVALIDATION message before (just like queries)
  change superpeer to only include valid files in a queryhit
    do we need this if we deregister invalid files?
    should we be deregistering/deleting invalid files, or just marking them so?
    if we're deleting, why do we need the invalid flag?
    if we have invalid files, do we need to automatically re-retrieve them?
  add option to client command prompt to "modify" a file that the peer client owns for testing
    select from list of files the peer client owns
    modification: add a line of text or something basic
  wrap all this code in "if(validationmethod == push)" if statement
  revalidation procedure?
    notify user when a file becomes invalid, give option to refresh it (retrieve the latest version)
