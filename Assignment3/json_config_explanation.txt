SUPERPEER
number of superpeers = length of this array = 8
i = id for superpeer
element at index i = list of superpeers to which superpeer i should connect

PEER
number of peers = length of this array = 17
j = config id for peer (actual useful id assigned by superpeer will be different; this is just for static configuration)
element at index j = id of superpeer to which peer with config id j should connect
each of the eight superpeers will have 1-3 peers connected to it

BUFFERSIZE
size of the historical message buffer
so a superpeer knows if it has seen/forwarded a query message before
and knows where to back-propagate a queryhit message

TTL
time to live
so a message is not forwarded indefinitely

validationMethod
whether files retrieved from other peers should be validated using a push-based approach or pull-based approach.
if pull-based, the TTR value will be used to know when to poll to validate a file.

TTR
time to refresh
an actual quantity of time IN SECONDS for how long the peer client should wait before polling the origin server
to check whether the file is valid.
